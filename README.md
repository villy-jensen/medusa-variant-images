## Accessing Variant Images

Once you have done all of the above, you will be able to access the variant images from each product variant's metadata.

```ts
type Images = {
  url: string;
};

// Example
const thumbnail: string | null | undefined = variant.metadata.thumbnail;
const images: Images[] | undefined = variant.metadata?.images;
```

## More About The Plugin

- Medusa Variant Images includes the ability to order your images and displays the number when you click on the images.
- You can also upload images using a **base option**.  
  For example: Let's say you have a clothing store. You can select the base option as colour and upload your images to all variants with its colour option set as *brown*, simultaneously.   
  To do this, click the `3 dots` at the top right of the variant images section in your product.
